## How the Fixes Work

### JavaScript Module Loading

The core issue was that Bootstrap was trying to use CommonJS-style `require()` calls in a browser environment where that's not available. Our fixes:

1. Create a shim for `require()` that returns appropriate global objects
2. Define global objects like `jQuery`, `$`, `Popper`, and `bootstrap` before they're needed
3. Dynamically load libraries in the correct order with proper dependencies
4. Implement error catching to prevent script execution from stopping

### Modals

Modal functionality was broken due to Bootstrap initialization issues. Our fixes:

1. Ensure Bootstrap is properly loaded before initializing modals
2. Create a shim for `bootstrap.Modal` that works even before Bootstrap loads
3. Re-wire all modal triggers and dismiss buttons with proper event handlers
4. Provide fallback mechanisms if Bootstrap modal functions fail

### Theme Switching

Theme switching wasn't applying correctly to all elements. Our fixes:

1. Update both HTML and body classes for theme consistency
2. Set explicit data-theme attributes
3. Force style recalculation through small DOM operations
4. Specifically target elements like cards, tables, and navbars to ensure proper theming
5. Implement theme-specific styles in CSS for elements like stats cards

### Stats Cards

Stats cards were missing due to styling issues. Our fixes:

1. Create dedicated CSS for stats cards with proper theming
2. Implement responsive design for different viewport sizes
3. Add hover effects and transitions for better UX
4. Ensure proper color variables and fallbacks

## Testing and Validation

These fixes have been tested on the following scenarios:

1. Initial page load with no cached files
2. Switching between light and dark themes
3. Opening and closing modals
4. Responsive testing on mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
5. JavaScript console monitoring for errors

## Potential Future Improvements

1. **Library Bundling**: Consider using a bundler like Webpack or Rollup to properly handle dependencies
2. **Module System**: Implement a proper ES modules system instead of relying on global objects
3. **CSS Variables**: Expand the use of CSS variables for better theme consistency
4. **Performance Optimization**: Reduce redundant style calculations and DOM manipulations

## Conclusion

The implemented fixes address all the reported issues by providing comprehensive solutions for JavaScript module loading, modal functionality, theme switching, and UI styling. The approach taken ensures backward compatibility while improving stability and user experience.
